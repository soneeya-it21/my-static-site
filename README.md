2. Push to GitHub Repository
Create a new repository on GitHub.
Push the index.html file (and any additional files such as CSS if required) to the repository.

3. Enable GitHub Pages
--Go to the Settings of your GitHub repository.
--Scroll down to the Pages section.
--Under Source, select the main branch and the root folder as the source for the Pages.
--Click Save.

4. Select Main Branch and Root Folder
--After saving the settings, GitHub Pages will deploy the site from the main branch.
--Make sure that your index.html is in the root directory of your repository.

5. Access Live Website
